Changes to BC and behavior in version 4.6.0
===========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- subtreeexpirycleanup.php cronjob is not activated by default.

  As DelayedCacheBlockCleanup is disabled this script is not activated by
  default. You can re-enable it by adding Scripts[]=subtreeexpirycleanup.php
  to cronjob.ini[CronjobSettings]

Change of behavior
------------------

- #016171: admin2: window_controls_user.tpl- adding new tabs in own extension

  The fix for this enhancement made it possible to extend tabs in admin2 without
  overriding the templates, this means the overrides for user tabs needs to be removed
  as the templates have been removed. The override.ini rules to remove are:

  [window_controls]
  Source=window_controls.tpl
  MatchFile=window_controls_user.tpl
  Subdir=templates
  Match[navigation_part_identifier]=ezusernavigationpart

  [windows]
  Source=windows.tpl
  MatchFile=windows_user.tpl
  Subdir=templates
  Match[navigation_part_identifier]=ezusernavigationpart

- #17656: Subtree limitation is not properly honored for multi-located contents

  Content read access is now checked at the node level instead of content object.
  For the record, this access is checked in eZNodeViewFunctions::contentViewGenerate()

- #18703: A user can remove any locations if he has right to delete one of them

  While removing a node, the content remove access is now checked at the node
  level instead of the content object.
